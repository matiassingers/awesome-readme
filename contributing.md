# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested READMEs should be beautiful or stand out in some way.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- When adding a new README, make sure to follow the existing visual and code style:
  - Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
  - Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
  - Provide screenshots for each README.
  - Wrap new list items into `<details>` to hide the screenshot.
  - Lock repo links to their current commits: `https://github.com/:owner/:repo/tree/:sha`
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
